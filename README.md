# thjx

## Run it

You might need to add permission to the operations script :
```
chmod u+x operations.py
```

### Addition
```
./operations.py addition
```

### Substraction
```
./operations.py substraction
```

## See outputs

The above commands output the different steps for the operations in the
terminal.

However, we stored the two program's outputs in the "outputs/" directory.
You can find, in text format (ASCII) the addition's and soustraction's steps.


## Overview

Those short python script were done under the THJX class given at EPITA,
in the SCIA major (promotion 2020), by Mr. HÃ©mon.


The goal of those short piece of code was to eases the debug when building
the 2 states operations in a 18 symbols (max) Turing Machine.

However, we though of expanding it to emulate the determistic game of MtG.
